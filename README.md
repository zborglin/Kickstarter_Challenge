# Kickstarter Excel Analysis

## **Overview:** Analysis of key parameters related to details of Kickstarter campaigns

### **Purpose:** The goal of this analysis is to give insight into how lunch dates and fundraising goals are linked to different campaign outcomes

## Analysis and Challenges
To perform this analysis, pivot tables and countifs tools were used to effectively filter and construct informative charts.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A potential challenge of this analysis strategy is to make sure you display the information that is most important for your intended audience. For example, you want to make sure you give relevant information to someone that is interested in theater campaigns, and not include information about technology campaigns for such a stakeholder. 
## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
#### Conclusion 1
Based on the launch date analysis of theater outcomes, it is best to initiate a campaign in May, just before the start of summer. There are many more successful campaigns that start in May relative to the other months, but similar amounts of failed campaigns which shows that there is a higher change of success for this launch month. 
#### Conclusion 2
Another observation that resulted from the launch date analysis is that December is the worst month to launch a campaign. This is likely due to this month containing many holidays and travel plans for individuals. 
### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Looking at the outcomes based on goal chart, a few conclusions can be made. Campaigns with goals of less than 1000 tend to be the most successful, and generally the rate of success drops as the goal increases. 
### What are some limitations of this dataset?
There are still some campaigns that are live which have been excluded from the analysis, it will be better when they complete and can be included. Additionally, it would be good to consider looking into the average contribution as a function of goal to understand what might be the most effective strategy for seeking funds. 
### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
An additional chart that would be useful is pledge amount based on goal to understand what the average contribution is based on the goal of the campaign. Additionally, it might be important to analyze outcomes based on launch date and goal as a function of country to better understand if certain markets behave differently. If Louise is planning to launch in GB or the US, there might be different dynamics at play that would be illuminated by this additional analysis.
